# Contributing
This project is single-handedly developed by me, Nefomemes, there's no other maintainers helping me developing this huge project.

So of course, contributions will always be appreciated. In this documentation, I'm just gonna dump everything you need in order to get start coding this thing.

## Things you need to prepare

- Your preferred text editor
- Git CLI, or your preferred Git client
- The latest version of Node.js

For the text editor itself, I myself preferred [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), or if you want the Code OSS experience (that's the open source version of VSC) you can check out [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium). If you want something else, there is Sublime Text and Notepad++, heck you can even use Vim.

## Step 1: Fork this repo and clone it from Git

Alright, the first thing you need is a fork repository of this repo. [You can just click this to fork this repo](https://github.com/Nefomemes/battlelog.js/fork).

After than we need to clone that fork repo into your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/battlelog.js.git
```

Do **not** add `/` to the end of the URL. This can cause an error when pushing back the changes later on.

If you are using a Git client then you can do stuff in your Git client. But of courfe. if you have Git CLI in your machine, you can run that command in your terminal and it should get displayed in your Git client as well.
